#Homework 1

This Readme file is prepared to explain how to run the python file called 'HW1code.py'included in this repository. 

You can find the dataset required for the python file in this repository as well. 

To run the python file correctly find the experiment number you want to test out and by selecting everything and use the Ctrl 
 / you can uncomment my code. I used three methods for each experiment. 
 
 
 Update after class on March 4th.
 The dummy variables created were 1 level short. It should be based on N level because the prediction model we are running 
 does not have an intercept. New version of the HW1code fixed that expression and updated performance measures.
